    "2. **Section-Level Detection**:\n",
    "   - Updated `check_red_flags` and `check_compliance` to parse headers (e.g., \"PART \\d+\", \"Clause \\d+\\.\\d+\") for the `section` field.\n",

    "   - Expanded `create_adgm_corpus` with detailed regulations simulating ADGM laws, covering incorporation, licensing, and HR contracts.\n",
    "4. **Gradio UI**:\n",
    "   - Added a Gradio interface (`gradio_interface`) for file upload, processing, and downloading commented `.docx` files.\n",
    "   - Outputs `compliance_output.json` and commented files.\n",
    "5. **Multiple Process Types**:\n",
    "   - Updated `define_checklists` to include \"Licensing\" and \"HR Contracts\" processes.\n",
    "6. **Downloadable .docx**:\n",
